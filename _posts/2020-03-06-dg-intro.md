For years, every 1-on-1 with my manager began the same way:

_“So…. What do you want to talk about?”_

Perfect – I had tons questions and feedback on a myriad of growth topics, perfect for these 1-on-1 moments:

* What steps can I take to further my career?
* How can I add value to the organization?
* How can I maximize my experience & learning?
* What can I do to become a better teammate?

This was a golden moment to ask these questions and start a candid conversation about my satisfaction and my career.

Naturally – I kept them all to myself.

That’s because, on the other end of my manager’s question was a young, inexperienced, and nervous 20-something engineer who was new to the workforce. My biggest fear in these moments was asking a stupid question, or one that would come off the wrong way.

Part of me even felt that my manager should be preemptively answering these questions for me without me even asking – as if he and I had some sort of Harry Potter / Voldemort connection and he could read my mind.

Instead of capitalizing on 1-on-1 opportunities to set a trajectory for my career and shape my experience at work, I never broached the topics I wanted to – and my motivation, engagement, and satisfaction suffered as a result.

Years later, I (somehow) became a people manager myself.

I made a commitment to myself that I would become the perfect people manager – motivating, engaging, empathetic, and accountable. I binged YouTube tutorials, blogs, and articles on management techniques (which, now looking back were entirely unenlightening and repetitive – probably the least fun YouTube rabbit hole to go down to be honest).

Armed with all of this, I, of course, still ended up being a pretty bad manager.

Despite my commitment, a huge problem reared its head quickly – I had no idea how to put what I heard and read into action.

I sat there now on the other side of the 1-on-1 meeting, facing a 20-something engineer, empathizing with my old manager.

There was critical information – key to ensuring the engagement, satisfaction, and motivation of my team – which I was unaware of and lacked the tools & techniques to ask:

* What motivates my reports?
* Where do they want to go in their career?
* Are they enjoying their time at work?
* Are they learning?

As it turns out, my experience as a new engineer and a new manager is not uncommon – nor is it benign.

The tech industry has the highest rate of attrition among all sectors (13%). According to a recent LinkedIn study, the biggest factors behind this metric can all be traced to ineffective management:

All of these concerns are solvable with candid, consistent conversations and proactive & engaged managers – which are unfortunately anomalies in the tech industry.

So, what is there to do?

How do close the rift between managers and their direct reports? How do we open lines of communication between managers and their employees? How do we provide engineers the prescriptive career development information they expect? How do we provide managers a guided framework for connecting with their direct reports? How do we increase satisfaction and engagement at work?

These are the questions we strive to answer at devgrow.

We’re out to build a platform to connect & empower managers & developers as people to foster personal & business growth… so next time a 20-something engineer walks into a 1-on-1 check-in with their manager, they know the impending conversation will be rich, candid, and impactful and they know it won’t start with:

_“So…. What do you want to talk about?”_
